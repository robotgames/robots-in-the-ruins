# Into the Tower of the Purple Hacker
Your crew of robot scavengers have heard tales about a bio-hacker living in the city.  The hacker lives high in the top of a tower, they integrate electronic and biological components to create their servants, and the color purple is associated with them.  Even their name is Violet.  The hacker holds sway over a small area around their tower.  Violet is rumored to have belonged to a group of hackers, betrayed them, and stole ... something.
