# An Introduction of Sorts

I wake.  Mayhaps I am a robot.  Perhaps not, difficult to say; my sensor array is cloudy.  Do humans have sensors?  Do robots say "mayhaps"?

This blog is about the development of a rules-light OSR-inspired tabletop role-playing game.  Characters are robots - probably - who scavenge for spare parts in the ruins of a city.

[Draft 0.2 of the rules is ready to go](https://github.com/robotgames/robots-in-the-ruins/raw/gh-pages/Robots%20in%20the%20Ruins%200.2.pdf).  Draft 0.1 was playtested and found to malfunction.
