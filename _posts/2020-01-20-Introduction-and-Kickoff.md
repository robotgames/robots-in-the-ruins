# An Introduction of Sorts

I wake.  Mayhaps I am a robot.  Perhaps not, difficult to say; my sensor array is cloudy.  Do humans have sensors?  Do robots say "mayhaps"?

This blog is about the development of a rules-light OSR-inspired tabletop role-playing game.  Characters are robots - probably - who scavenge for spare parts in the ruins of a strange city.

## Updates
[Draft 0.2 of the rules is ready to go](https://github.com/robotgames/robots-in-the-ruins/raw/gh-pages/Robots%20in%20the%20Ruins%200.2.pdf).  Draft 0.1 was playtested and found to malfunction.

Draft 0.2 includes:
* The basic rules, a few pages.
* Some notes for the Referee.
* A (very) basic character sheet.
* A micro-setting, *Mother's Little Helper*.

What updates are in the works?
* Longer adventures.
* A guide to using an irl city for RitR games.
* Some art.
* Thoughts on running your robots as characters in OSR modules.  Can robots handle the Borderlands?  Can you use the activation->max d6 mechanic alongside another ruleset?  Does this even make sense as a thought experiment?

## Tools: When is the building going to fall?
I hate to answer questions during a game; I prefer to pose them.  When I really need to know the answer to an important question in the game, I like to let the dice gods speak when possible and convenient.  So, here are two ways to decide when the building is going to fall.

Method 1: Use a dice pool timer.  Give the building a rating 5-10.  Begin with 1d in the pool (all are d6).  Each time a character does something risky or shaky in the building, let them save DEX to see if they can avoid shaking the building.  On a failure, roll the dice pool timer.  For each die that shows a 4+, add another die to the pool.  Whenever the timer is rolled and there are a number of 4+ values equaling the building's rating, it collapses.

Method 2: Use a Jenga tower with 12 layers, mentally label them from bottom up 1 through 12.  Each time a character does something risky or shaky and fails a DEX save, roll d12.  Remove a Jenga block at or below the layer of the tower with the rolled value.  The building collapses when the Jenga tower collapses.  *I know, I know, this is not to the taste of some because it relies on a player's dexterity.  That's why Method 1 is up there!*

## Thoughts on running the game
The character's explorations in the ruined city can be approached as a hex crawl, and expeditions into buildings or sewers or subway systems as dungeon crawls (*sort of*, more on that in a later post).  There are many tools out there that can help run these aspects of the game.  Make a few random tables specific to your city and themses, and you're ready to go.

What's special about a ruined city?  Should we treat it any differently from a wilderness crawl?
