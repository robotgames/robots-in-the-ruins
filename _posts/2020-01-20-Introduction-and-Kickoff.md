# An Introduction of Sorts

I wake.  Mayhaps I am a robot.  Perhaps not, difficult to say; my sensor array is cloudy.  Do humans have sensors?  Do robots say "mayhaps"?

This blog is about the development of a rules-light OSR-inspired tabletop role-playing game.  Characters are robots - probably - who scavenge for spare parts in the ruins of a strange city.

[Draft 0.2 of the rules is ready to go](https://github.com/robotgames/robots-in-the-ruins/raw/gh-pages/Robots%20in%20the%20Ruins%200.2.pdf).  Draft 0.1 was playtested and found to malfunction.

Draft 0.2 includes:
* The basic rules, a few pages.
* Some notes for the Referee.
* A (very) basic character sheet.
* A micro-setting, *Mother's Little Helper*.

What updates are in the works?
* Longer adventures.
* A guide to using an irl city for RitR games.
* Some art.
* Thoughts on running your robots as characters in OSR modules.  Can robots handle the Borderlands?  Can you use the activation->max d6 mechanic alongside another ruleset?  Does this even make sense as a thought experiment?
